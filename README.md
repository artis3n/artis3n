Hello there.

I've been a security engineer and penetration tester and currently trick companies into letting me lead Application Security programs. You may have [read an article](https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/enabling-engineering-teams-developer-first-secrets-management) or [heard me speak](https://youtu.be/BPF18NVKI1A?si=jPmnbUDW32YjbmXS) about the importance of a collaborative, enablement-minded security organization.

I tend to build open source projects around improving the user experience of security tooling and integrations.
The secure thing should be the easiest thing for a developer to do.

Some of my public projects include:
- [`artis3n.tailscale`](https://github.com/artis3n/ansible-role-tailscale) Ansible role to manage [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) on your servers
- [`digitalocean/github-oidc/vault`](https://github.com/digitalocean-labs/terraform-vault-github-oidc) Terraform module for GitHub OIDC auth to Hashicorp Vault from GitHub Action runners
- [`artis3n/ansible_galaxy_collection`](https://github.com/artis3n/ansible_galaxy_collection) GitHub Action to deploy an Ansible collection to Ansible Galaxy
